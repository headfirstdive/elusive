A Package of small but useful Unity extensions and utilities

### Animation Assistant
#### Add and group animations to an AnimationController asset in the project view.
Unity does not allow adding animation clips to AnimationControllers in the project view. 
Some of Unity's utilities actually do it behind the scenes (for example when adding transition animations to a Button), but there is no built in way to do it.
This utility allows us to select a group of animations and an animation controller in the project view, and group them together, keeping the project view cleaner.
